should we automate this?
pools.set() needs to be done manually so maybe after we do that FOR BOTH EULER AND NONTV we can iterate through newPools.json

    pools.set(seriesId, pool)

    if (!(await pool.hasRole(ROOT, timelock.address))) {
      await pool.grantRole(ROOT, timelock.address)
      console.log(`pool.grantRoles(ROOT, timelock)`)
      while (!(await pool.hasRole(ROOT, timelock.address))) {}
    }
